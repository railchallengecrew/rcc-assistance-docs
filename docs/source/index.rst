Welcome to the RCC Assistance Bot Documentation!
===================================
.. note::

   This project is in beta testing phase. Many commands are unfinished, and the bot may be very buggy.

These docs act mainly as a help page for the commands which are currently avalible.
**These commands are not final, and may be changed before the release.**
These docs are designed for admins and moderators. Most (if not all) of the commands listed here are designed for moderator / admin use only.
The bot only supports Discord's slash commands.
